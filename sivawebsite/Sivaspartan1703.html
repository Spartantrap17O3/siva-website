  <h3>Passkey accepted, Welcome Guardian.<h3>

  <p>The Siva incident was one of the most dangeouse threats the guardians had to face, but the last city's defenders never faltered even when facing the main threat, Aksis, Archon Prime.
  Lord Salidan started the iron banner again after that to continue training new lights to be ready if it ever happened again, and it almost did when Erimis, the Shipstealer started searching
the tower ruins for the guardian crafted Outbreak Prime. Luckily a friendly fallen captin alerted the guardians and stopped her before she could escape. Even though the Outbreak Prime was now the
Outbreak Perfected because of the siva nanites it kept produceing, no other siva incidents have been recorded but the plaugelands will remain under quarentine until all siva nanites are dealt with,
 which might take months even years to complete. In the meantime, there are multiple weapons, structures, and HVTs to deal with that have been infected by siva.  </p>
