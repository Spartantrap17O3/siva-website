    FILE_WILHEIM-7
    <p> Wilheim-7 and a team of 3 other guardians had followed a vandal into a loot cave only to get lost . Wilheim didn't give up so he and the group went further and found an incredable amount of loot and exotics. After about 5-7 days though, the loot started poinsining their minds and slowly turned them against each other one by one. First it was a simple team kill over a mid-teir gun, next it was a ghost destroyed and a final death. After 12 days, Wilheim used on of his ghostless teamates as a pack mule to carry the loot. Then when Wilheim caught that guardian stealing his loot, he killed him. After almost 25-30 days, Wilheim set a trap for his last remaining teamate thinking he was trying to trick him adn steal all the loot. After day 40, Wilheim Was ghostless and was bleeding out oil. The last log was found by his corpse, all coverd in crystals like it had been there for a while. The Guardian known as Evade recovered these logs and reported back. authorization has been given to all eligable guardians to go into the cave and clear out the fallen and collect some loot. Not to much loot is to be collected incase of another event like Wilheim's.</p>
